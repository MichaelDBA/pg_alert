### CONFIGURATION FILE FOR PG_ALERT.PY PROGRAM 
###
### Michael Vitale        6/22/2012       Original coding
### Michael Vitale        12/25/2016      New parameters added
### Michael Vitale        01/28/2017      SMTP parameters added
### Michael Vitale        05/22/2021      RDS, DBID parameters added
### Michael Vitale        06/06/2021      Modified local log file logic. Also, PGPORT renamed to DBPORT
###
### 2 sections in this configuration file: required and optional
### Optional fields have defaults as specified.
###
### # indicates a comment line
### Commas are the default delimiter unless specified otherwise.
###
### Some optional fields are dynamic, meaning a changed value will be 
### picked up by the program within the next 5 minutes.  
### Look for keyword, "dynamic" in the commented description of the field.
###
### boolean fields can be either yes/no or true/false
